#Episode 3

JSX -> React.createElement (which is an object) -> HTML Element 
This whole transpilation is done by babel which is govern by Parcel
babel is just another package which parcel uses to transpile the code before reaching to the js engine.

two ways to create components in react.
1. Functional component
2. Class component


React Functional component is a normal javascript function which returns a jsx.

## differnce between react component and React element?


In React component any js can be executed. That's why there might be threat fo cross site scripting attack
through api. but react takes care of it. and it actually doesn't executer every data blindly, it actually filters the data.


#Episode 4

/*
 * Header
    - Logo
    - Nav Items
 * Body
    - Search
    - RestaurantContainer
      - RestaurantCard
        - Image
        - Name of Res, Star Rating, cuisine, delervery title
 * Footer
    - Copyright
    - Links
    - Address
    - Contact
 */

what is prop? 
prop -> property
we can pass data as prop to component.
prop is an object
props can be destructured on the fly {}


** config driven UI 

whenever we use map in react we need to give a unique key property to each child element.
and we should not use index as key.



#Episode 5


From a module only one dafault export is allowed. 
So when we have to export multiple things from one component we use Named export

export const Variable_name = "..."

Default export/import 

export default component;
import Component from "path";

Named export/import

export const Component;
import {Component} from "path";

## React Hooks
(Normal utility Javascript functions developed by facebook developers)

- useState() ~ Super powerfull react state Variable
it returns an array. then we can do the array destrucruring on the fly.
- useEffect()

Whenever a state variable updates/changes, react rerenders the component.
The logic of updating the UI is called rerendering.
React keeps sync between UI layer and data layer that's why its very fast
ast DOM operations it automatically rerenders the UI as soon as the data/state
changes.

** React uses Reconciliation algorithm which is known as (React Fiber). => React-16
React Fiber(new Reconciliation process to efficiently manipulation the DOM) 
is a new way to find the div and updating the DOM.
virtual dom is a representation of actual DOM which is nothing but an object.

## Diff algorithm
React uses two virtual DOM to update the UI
Previous Virtual DOM and Updated Virtual DOM
using this algorithm react keeps track of the differences between thease two virtual DOMs
and then it will update the actual DOM on every render cycle.

React is fast because it does efficient DOM manipulation using virtual DOM

# Episode 6:

1. Monolith architecture
All the services/usecases (UI, backend, sms service, Authentication, DB) written in
a single project


2. Microservice architecture
For all the services there are different different projects

How do the services communicate with each other?
- Through api calls/different different port numbers

- Seperation of concerns -> Follow a single responsibility principle


- useEffect()
This is nothing but a simple js function which takes two arguments
first is and callback function and second is dependency array

the useEffect function will call the callback function
after the initial render of the component is done.

we will use it when we want something to happen after the react render cycle is 
finished.

fetch() is not part of js. it is a part of browser's js engine.
It is used to make api calls.


## conditional rendering 
rendering according to certain condition

** why we need state variables why not normal js variables?

Reason is when a normal variable got changed the UI doesn't re rendered to show
the change in the UI. but when a state variable changes it triggers the 
render process and the UI gets updated with the new changed variable.

if there is a header component and inside it there is a button with text = "login"
we want to toggle the text between "login" and "logout".
But the question arries, when we click on the button only the button gets refreshed
or the whole header component gets re-rendered within which the button is clicked?

=> Answer is react will start the Reconciliation process, 
evalute between two virtual dom, previous dom and dom with 
the updated text. Then react will rerender the whole header component but only
update the button in the dom (because dom manipulation is expensive), 
which makes react super fast.


const [text, setText] = useState("login");

when we clicking the button the text gets changed to "logout"
but the question is can we change a constant variable?
no right. then? what is happening behind the scene?

--> when a constant state variable gets changed at the same time the componet gets
re-rendered with the updated text.The previous const text and the updated const text 
is completely different hence the js rule being followed.


"Why is it behaving the way it is behaving?"

** It is not the virtual DOM that makes react fast, 
it is the React Fiber, the new Reconciliation algorithm which finds 
out the differences between two virtual DOM and updates the DOM only when its required 
and only that portion which is required.

#Episode 7

useEffect
-> If no dependency array passed -> will be called after each render 
-> If empty array passed -> will be called only once after the first render
-> If any dependency(state) passed in the array -> will be called only when the dependency updates

In a react app we should not use anchor tag because it reloads the page
Instead we should use <Link> from react-router-dom it doesn't reload the whole page 
it just refresh the component. That is why react is known for
single page application.

** 2 types of routing
1. Server Side routing

suppose there is an index.html, about.html, contact.html
If I click on the anchor tag(/about.html). It reloads the whole page.
It send and network call to about.html fetches the html and render it to the web page.


2. Client Side routing

In react we use client side routing. We do not make any network call to render
our page because all the components are already loaded to our app.


Link component (react-router-dom) is just a wrapper over normal html anchor tag.


#Episode 8

class based components are just normal class in react.

React.Component is a class given by react which we are inheriting from react to 
create class based components.

what is super(props) inside constructor function?
- When we call this super(props), we are basically calling the constructor of React.Component. So we can say that super() is a reference to the parent class constructor.

React will not recongnize "this" keyword until super() function has been called.

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-the-use-of-superprops/


Never update state variables directly in classbase components.
It will lead to inconsistency in code.
Instead we will use "this.setState"

if there are 10 states in "this.state" object.
when we update one state value using "this.setState" react won't touch the other 
states but only the updated object.


**lifecycle methods in react**

when a class loades (a new instance of the class) constructor method is called.
then render is called.

Inside a class component, first constructor function is called and then render 
method is called and once this class based component mounted on the dom then 
componentDidMount is called.

constructor -> render -> componentDidMount

we do api calls inside componentDidMount or in case of functional component inside
useEffect -> but why do we do that?

The reason is as soon as the component mounts, we show something on the UI.
then we make api calls and according to the results, we updates the UI again.
In this way user gets a better user experience.

https://projects.wojtekmaj.pl/react-lifecycle-methods-diagram/

React has two phases
1. render phase
In this phase first constructor will be called and then render
2. commit phase
In this phase react updates the dom (most expensive step - takes time) and 
then componentDidMount will be called

suppose inside a parent multiple children component is present
so what would be the life cycle?

constructor of parent -> render of parent -> React will batch the render phase of
all the child components together for more optimized performance because commit phase
is expensive, DOM manupulation will be there.

After compleating the render phase of all the child components react will complete 
the commit phase of all the child components then finally when all the child 
components are mounted on the DOM then Parent component's componentDidMount will be called.

**** api call in class component ****

we can make componentDidMount function async to make asynchronous calls

async componentDidMount(){
  const data = await fetch("url");
  const json = data.json();
}
